# Customer-Churn-Analysis-of-a-Teecom-company
**#Goal/Problem:**
The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn, identifying key patterns and factors that contribute to customers leaving a service. Understanding these factors helps businesses design strategies to improve customer retention.

**Technology Used/Approach:**

Data Analysis: The dataset was explored to identify trends and relationships among features such as customer demographics, account details, and usage patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Missing values were handled, categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled to prepare the data for further analysis.
Visualization: Charts and graphs were used to highlight important trends and correlations, such as the impact of tenure and contract type on churn rates.
**Recommendations:**

Focus on reducing churn by improving customer experience for high-risk groups, such as those with month-to-month contracts or higher charges.
Leverage insights from the analysis to develop customer retention programs, such as loyalty rewards or discounts for long-term commitments.
Consider extending this analysis by implementing machine learning models to predict churn and refine intervention strategies.
This project provides a foundational understanding of customer churn and actionable insights for improving retention.
